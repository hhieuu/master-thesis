Things have done:
- Preparing data, variables
- Trial estimation using LASSO

To work on:
- Adaptive LASSO? for Oracle properties
- How to optimize for lambda? CV?
- Inference
- Estimation periods?
<<<<<<< HEAD
- ADF tests probably?

**** 28.08.2019
To do:
- Figure out how to CV glmnet
- Test for stationarity in all TS?
- Make TS stationary?
- Then the problem of near-collinear/near-singular regression arise?
- Adaptive LASSO needs to be worked on. How to do adaptive LASSO?

#### BRANCH: STATIONARITY/NEAR-COLLINEAR REGRESSION
**** 28.08.2019 evening
What I did:
- Ran ADF tests, some are I(1) -> review on regressing with I(1) AR process
      -> what does this have to do with near-singular regression
- Try to do CV, but not concrete and satisfactory. Already found a way to conveniently split TS data ('caret' packages)
      -> Read more on what CV does to find optimal lambda? MSE? PE?
Things to find:
- Is it necessary to use adaptive LASSO wrt its oracle property?
- How about 2-step method for correct coverage of CI? Why does it fail? Does it fail at all?

**** 29.08.2019 evening
What I did:
- Detecting collinearity

More to do:
- Is regression near-singular?
- What to do with near-singularity in context of LASSO?
- Make variables stationary? Read more on regression with unit root (Phillips)

Next up:
- Adaptive LASSO
- 2-step method
