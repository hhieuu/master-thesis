Things have done:
- Preparing data, variables
- Trial estimation using LASSO

To work on:
- Adaptive LASSO? for Oracle properties
- How to optimize for lambda? CV?
- Inference
- Estimation periods?
<<<<<<< HEAD
- ADF tests probably?

**** 28.08.2019
To do:
- Figure out how to CV glmnet
- Test for stationarity in all TS?
- Make TS stationary?
- Then the problem of near-collinear/near-singular regression arise?
- Adaptive LASSO needs to be worked on. How to do adaptive LASSO?

- ADF tests probably?
